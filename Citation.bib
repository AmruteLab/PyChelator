	abstract = {Metal ions play vital roles in regulating various biological systems, making it essential to control the concentration of free metal ions in solutions during experimental procedures. Several software applications exist for estimating the concentration of free metals in the presence of chelators, with MaxChelator being the easily accessible choice in this domain. This work aimed at developing a Python version of the software with arbitrary precision calculations, extensive new features, and a user-friendly interface to calculate the free metal ions.},
