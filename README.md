  <h1>maxchelator.js - Chelator-Metal Complex Information Calculator</h1>
  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>maxchelator.js is a custom JavaScript code that facilitates the calculation and display of chelator-metal complex information based on specified parameters. It serves as a helpful tool for researchers, scientists, and professionals working with metal-chelator interactions who need to obtain critical data related to these complexes.</p>

  <h2>Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Calculation of Chelator-Metal Complexes:</strong> The maxchelator.js script performs complex calculations involving chelators and metal ions, taking into account essential factors like pH, temperature, and ionic strength. This allows users to evaluate the binding of metal ions to chelators accurately.</li>
    <li><strong>Structured Output:</strong> The code provides a comprehensive output, including the total amounts of chelators, free chelators, bound chelators, and the percentage of bound chelators. The results are structured in a way that makes them easy to understand.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic HTML Display:</strong> maxchelator.js dynamically generates HTML elements, such as tables, to showcase the calculated data. This enables users to visualize the chelator-metal complex information in an organized and user-friendly manner directly on an HTML page.</li>
     <li><strong>Downloadable Results:</strong> Users can download the calculated results in an Excel file format (xlsx) for further analysis and storage.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Flexibility and Customization:</h2>
  <p>maxchelator.js is designed to be flexible, allowing users to adjust the code to fit their specific needs. Additionally, the library is complemented by a Python script (maxchelator.py) that users can utilize for further analysis and customization.</p>
  <p>Users are encouraged to modify the Python script (maxchelator.py) according to their unique requirements, enabling them to integrate maxchelator.js with their existing Python-based workflows and projects.</p>

  <h2>How to Use:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Set Parameters:</strong> Before performing calculations, set the necessary parameters, such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength. This ensures accurate results based on specific experimental conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Execute Calculation:</strong> Invoke the provided docalc() function after setting the parameters. This function processes the data and stores the results in the totalchelatoramount_component array.</li>
    <li><strong>Display and Download the Results:</strong> Utilize the provided functions to dynamically create an HTML table and display the calculated chelator-metal complex information. The results will be presented in a clear and structured format for easy interpretation. Additionally, users can download the results as an Excel file for further analysis and storage.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Compatibility:</h2>
  <p>maxchelator.js is designed to work with modern web browsers and supports JavaScript-based web applications. It is versatile and can be integrated into various web projects related to metal-chelator interactions.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
  <p>While maxchelator.js aims to provide accurate and useful data, users are advised to validate the results obtained from the code with experimental data and consult domain experts for critical applications.</p>
